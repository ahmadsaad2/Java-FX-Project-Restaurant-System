JavaFX project, in database course,
My project is a JavaFX-based program for KFC restaurant, leveraging Oracle database and JavaFX GUI. This program streamlines operations, empowering managers to handle employees, inventory, and store management, while employees efficiently process orders.
this hands-on experience allowed me to utilize a range of skills, including Java, JavaFX, SQL, CSS, and even Jasper Reports. hashtag#JavaFX hashtag#DatabaseCourse hashtag#TeamProject hashtag#Java hashtag#SQL hashtag#CSS hashtag#JasperReports
